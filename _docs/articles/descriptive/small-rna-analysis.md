title: Small RNA Analysis
---

The Small RNA workflow measures the abundance of various types of short RNA sequences, particularly miRNA. It is suitable for identifying and quantifying miRNA expression and for comparing abundance across samples.
The Small RNA workflow can only be used to analyze MiSeq sequencing results

The small RNA analysis App Results page provides access to two graphs.

- [Clusters Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_10)
- [Trimmed Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_20)

The Small RNA Sample Details Page provides three panes:

- [Small RNA Samples Table](/articles/descriptive/small-rna-samples-table/)
- [Small RNA Pie Chart](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_6)
- [Small RNA Graph](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_7)
