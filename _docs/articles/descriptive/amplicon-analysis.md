title: Custom/PCR Amplicon
---

The Custom/PCR Amplicon workflow evaluates short regions of amplified DNA (amplicons) for variants. The focused sequencing of amplicons enables high-coverage sequencing of particular regions across many samples. The main output files generated by the Custom/PCR Amplicon workflow are BAM files (containing the aligned reads) and VCF files (containing the variant calls). 

The Custom/PCR Amplicon workflow supports multiple manifests (containing the probe regions) and consensus sequence reporting for multi-manifest runs.

The Custom/PCR Amplicon workflow can only be used to analyze MiSeq sequencing results

The Custom/PCR Amplicon App Results Page provides a four graphs:

- [Low Percentage Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_0)
- [High Percentage Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_5)
- [Clusters Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_10)
- [Mismatch Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_15)


The PCR amplicon Sample Details page provides six panes:
 
- [Samples Table](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_0)
- [Amplicons Table](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_1)
- [Coverage Graph](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_2)
- [Q-Score Graph](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_3)
- [Variant Score Graph](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_4)
- [Variants Table](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_5)

The graphs and variants table display data for the amplicon that is selected in the Amplicon Table.
