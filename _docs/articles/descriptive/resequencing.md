title: Resequencing

The sample sheet driven Resequencing app compares the DNA sequence in the samples against a reference genome and identifies any variants (SNPs or indels) relative to the reference sequence. The main output files generated by the Resequencing workflow are BAM files (containing the alignment results) and VCF files (containing the variant calls).

The Resequencing workflow can only be used to analyze MiSeq sequencing results.

The Resequencing App Results Page provides four graphs:

- [Low Percentage Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_0)
- [High Percentage Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_5)
- [Clusters Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_10)
- [Mismatch Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_15)

The Resequencing Sample Details Page provides five panes:

- [Samples Table](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_0)
- [Coverage Graph](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_2)
- [Q-Score Graph](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_3)
- [Variant Score Graph](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_4)
- [Variants Table](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_5)

The graphs and variants table display data for the chromosome that is selected in the drop-down list.
