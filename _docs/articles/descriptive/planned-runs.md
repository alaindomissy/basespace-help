You can sort the list of Runs by clicking the column headers.  You can also click a Run to view the **Plan Run** page where you can edit its properties. For more information about these actions, see **How to Plan Runs**.

The runs can have the following states:

- Ready to Sequence: the run can be started from the NextSeq sequencing system.
- Planning: The run is still in the planning phase so it will not be discovered by the NextSeq machine yet

{% callout note, NOTE %}
If you want to select multiple runs:

- Select multiple checkboxes
- Click anywhere on a planned run row while holding Ctrl button to add to a selection
- Click anywhere on a planned run row while holding Shift button to select all runs in between
- Click the checkbox next Experiment Name to select all planned runs on the current page

{% endcallout %}

The box next to the Planned Runs header tracks the total number of runs, and how many are selected. Click X next to the selection count to clear the current selection.
When sequencing on a run starts, the run is removed automatically from the Planned Runs list.
