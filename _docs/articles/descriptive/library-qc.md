The Library QC workflow is intended for evaluating the abundance, fragment length, and sample quality of libraries. The analysis performed in the Library QC workflow is similar to the Resequencing workflow. The Library QC workflow does not perform variant calling; instead, it provides a report of the characteristics of each sample.
The Library QC workflow can only be used to analyze MiSeq sequencing results

The Library QC App Results page provides a four graphs:

- [Low Percentage Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_0)
- [High Percentage Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_5)
- [Clusters Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_10)
- [Mismatch Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_15)

The Library QC Sample Details Page provides four panes:

- [Samples Table](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_0)
- [Coverage Graph](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_2)
- [Q-Score Graph](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_3)
- [Sample QC Table](/articles/descriptive/sample-details-page-components/#headings_10)

The graphs display data for the chromosome that is selected in the drop-down list.
