title: Generate FASTQ
---

The app Generate FASTQ does not perform any analysis, but generates FASTQ files for download and shows basic summary data. The Generate FASTQ app can be used with all sequencing instruments that BaseSpace supports. For more information, see [FASTQ Files](/articles/descriptive/fastq-files/).

Generate FASTQ is also used to analyze RNA-Seq samples from MiSeq.
