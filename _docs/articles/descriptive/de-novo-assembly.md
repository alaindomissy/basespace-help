title: De Novo Assembly
---

The Assembly workflow enables de novo assembly of a draft genome directly from the sequencing reads. Because assembly relies upon significant coverage of the genome, this workflow is best suited for the assembly of small genomes (up to 5 to 10 MB). The assembly process uses the Velvet software (Velvet: algorithms for de novo short read assembly using de Bruijn graphs (2008) D.R. Zerbino and E. Birney. Genome Research 18:821â€“829).
The Assembly workflow can only be used to analyze MiSeq sequencing results

The de novo assembly App Results page provides access to three graphs:

- [Low Percentage Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_0)
- [High Percentage Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_5)
- [Clusters Graph](/articles/descriptive/workflow-graphs/#headings_10)

The De Novo Assembly Sample Details Page provides two panes:

- [De Novo Assembly Samples Table](/articles/descriptive/de-novo-assembly-samples-table/)
- [Samples Graph](/articles/descriptive/samples-graph/)
