title: Description of the Run Summary section for a Sequencing Run
---
-----------------------

# Run Summary

The Run Summary page can be accessed by first selecting a Run in BaseSpace then clicking on the **Run Summary** button in the left-hand navigation pane.

## What is it?
The Run Summary page shows tables with basic data quality metrics that are summarized per lane and per read. All the statistics are given as means and standard deviations over the tiles used in the lane.

## When to use it.
When looking at basic data quality metrics for a run from primary analysis.

## When not to use it.
The tables do not contain information about samples or projects. The tables also do not contain app-generated information (secondary or tertiary analysis).

## How to use it.

The following metrics are displayed in the top table, split out by read and total:

If no PhiX control sample is run in the lane, this chart shows 0% and the number of cycles used. This value is not calculated for NextSeq two-channel sequencing, and the value shown is always zero |
| Error Rate                       | The calculated error rate of the reads that aligned to PhiX                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Phasing/Prephasing  | The value used by RTA for the percentage of molecules in a cluster for which sequencing falls behind (phasing) or jumps ahead (prephasing) the current cycle within a read.  For MiSeq and NextSeq, RTA generates phasing and prephasing estimates empirically for every cycle. The value displayed here is therefore not used in the actual phasing/prephasing calculations, but is an aggregate value determined from the first 25 cycles. For most applications, the value reported is very close to the value that is applied. For low diversity samples or samples with unbalanced base composition, the reported value can diverge from the values being applied because the value changes from cycle to cycle. |
| Reads               | The number of clusters (in millions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
