You can simply follow these steps to create new biological samples:

{% callout note, NOTE %}
You can use the import function to create several new samples at one time, for more information see [Import Biological Samples](/articles/tutorials/import-biological-samples/).
{% endcallout %}
<br />
{% step 1, /images/articles/biological-samples-tab_767x321.png, Select Biological Samples %}
Click on the Prep tab and click on Biological samples.
{% endstep %}

{% step 2, /images/tutorials/create-biological-samples-button.png, Click on Create %}
Click the + Create button.
{% endstep %}

{% step 3, /images/tutorials/biological-samples-fields.png, Fill out the fields %}
Fill out the required fields; Sample ID, Name, and Nucleic Acid type. Optionally, you can fill out the Organism (species) field and the Project field. You can also generate a new project by clicking on the Project selector and then clicking on the **New...** button. The project field is optional, but you will be required to provide it later in order to store your data.
{% endstep %}

{% callout note, NOTE %}
-	The Sample ID and Sample Name fields support alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores. Sample ID has to be unique and brief; Sample Name can be more descriptive to provide a human-readable identifier.
-	The Organism (species) field is optional.
-	The Project field is optional, but if you do not specify it here, you must set it later, because the output data gets stored to the project.
-	Fill out the Nucleic Acid column with DNA or RNA.
{% endcallout %}

When finished, do one of the following:

-	If you only want to select the newly created sample, click the **Prep Libraries** button. Continue with [Prep Libraries](/articles/tutorials/prep-libraries/).  Please see the image below for an example.
-	If you want to select multiple samples, click the **Save & Continue Later** button. This selection takes you back to the Biological Samples list, with the recently created sample at the top of the list. Continue with [Use Existing Biological Samples](/articles/tutorials/use-existing-biological-samples/).
