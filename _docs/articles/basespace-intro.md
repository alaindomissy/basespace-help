BaseSpace is a powerful website where biologists and  informaticians can easily store, analyze, and share genetic data.  

BaseSpace is directly integrated into the NextSeq, MiSeq, and HiSeq sequencing platforms. When setting up runs on your sequencing instrument, you can send the run to BaseSpace. BaseSpace can automatically run analysis jobs using the Illumina MiSeq workflow apps. It also allows you to use the third-party apps to analyze your data.
